Every ML trading system faces the same structural gap: the model optimises a
proxy — MSE, cross-entropy, TD-error — while performance is measured in
realised PnL. The better the proxy fits, the less it guarantees about actual
returns.

DiffQuant closes this gap by design. The pipeline — from raw market features
through a differentiable mark-to-market simulator to the Sharpe ratio — is a
single computation graph. `loss.backward()` optimises what the strategy
actually earns, not a surrogate for it.

## How it works

The full pipeline is a single differentiable computation graph:
features[t−ctx:t] → PolicyNetwork → position_t → DiffSimulator → −Sharpe → ∂/∂θ

The simulator implements exact mark-to-market accounting as tensor operations —
no surrogate losses, no reward shaping. The entire chain is differentiable:
```
ret_t      = (close_t − close_{t−1}) / close_{t−1}
gross_t    = position_{t−1} × ret_t
cost_t     = smooth_abs(Δpos_t) × (commission + slippage)
net_pnl_t  = gross_t − cost_t
```

`smooth_abs(x) = √(x² + ε)` replaces `|x|` to preserve C∞ differentiability
through transaction cost computation — critical when the model is near-flat.

### Policy head: direction × gate
```python
position = tanh(direction_raw / τ_dir) × sigmoid(gate_raw / τ_gate)
```

`direction` encodes the alpha signal; `gate` encodes whether to trade at all.
When confidence is low, `gate → 0` and `position → 0` regardless of direction.
This is the differentiable analogue of action masking. Gate bias is initialised to −1.0, ensuring the model starts in a cautious near-flat regime and only opens positions when accumulated gradient evidence justifies the exposure. This stabilises the early training phase when policy outputs are noisy.

### Training objective
```python
L = λ₁·(−Sharpe) + λ₂·turnover + λ₃·drawdown + λ₄·terminal + λ₅·(flat_soft − flat_target)² + λ₆·|mean(pos)|
```

Each term addresses a specific failure mode: `turnover` prevents commission drag;
`drawdown` discourages extended underwater periods; `terminal` penalises open
risk at episode end; `flat_target` prevents permanent flat collapse; `bias`
penalises always-long or always-short behaviour — proved critical for symmetric
long/short learning on trending BTC training data.

---

## Validation protocol

Both training validation and backtest use continuous walk-forward evaluation —
the same mechanics as live execution:
```python
for t in range(ctx_len, N):
    window   = features[t − ctx : t]       # past ctx bars only
    position = model(normalize(window))     # single forward pass
    pnl_t    = prev_pos × ret_t − commission × |Δpos|
    # position carried to next bar — no resets
```

The same `WalkForwardEvaluator` runs during training (every `val_freq` epochs)
and at final evaluation. There is no separate validation logic anywhere else
in the codebase — this is intentional.

## Experiments

| Config | Backbone | Loss | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `itransformer_sharpe` | iTransformer | −Sharpe only | Ablation: loss function contribution |
| `itransformer_hybrid` | iTransformer | Hybrid | **Primary experiment** |
| `lstm_hybrid` | LSTM (bidir.) | Hybrid | Backbone comparison |

The three configs share the same data, simulator, and evaluation protocol.
Any performance difference is attributable to the architecture or loss alone.

---

## Configuration
```python
# Minimal override example
from configs.base_config import MasterConfig

cfg = MasterConfig(experiment_name="itransformer_hybrid")
cfg.backbone.type           = "itransformer"
cfg.loss.type               = "hybrid"
cfg.loss.lambda_turnover    = 0.01
cfg.loss.lambda_bias        = 0.25          # penalises always-long / always-short
cfg.loss.lambda_flat_target = 0.5           # prevents permanent flat collapse
cfg.data.preset             = "ohlcv"       # open, high, low, close, volume
cfg.data.add_rolling_vol    = True          # causal rolling volatility channel
cfg.data.timeframe_min      = 30            # aggregate 1-min source to 30-min bars

```

Feature presets: `"ohlc"` | `"ohlcv"` (default) | `"full"` | `"custom"`.

## Dataset

| | |
|---|---|
| Asset | BTCUSDT Binance Futures (USDⓈ-M perpetual) |
| Source resolution | 1-minute bars (close-time convention) |
| HuggingFace | [`ResearchRL/diffquant-data`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ResearchRL/diffquant-data) |
| Period | 2021-01-01 — 2025-12-31 |

Dataset: [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ResearchRL/diffquant-data)

Temporal splits (all non-overlapping):

| Split | Period | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Train    | 2021-01-01 → 2025-03-31 | Gradient updates |
| Val      | 2025-04-01 → 2025-06-30 | Model selection during training |
| Test     | 2025-07-01 → 2025-09-30 | Out-of-sample evaluation |
| Backtest | 2025-10-01 → 2025-12-31 | Final held-out evaluation |

Aggregation from 1-min to any target timeframe uses `origin="epoch"` alignment,
ensuring bars always land on clock boundaries (:00, :05, :10, … for 5-min).
Primary experiment uses 30-min bars: context = 96 bars (48 hours), horizon = 24 bars (12 hours).

## Experimental status

DiffQuant is an active research project. The results below represent the first
promising configuration found during initial experimentation. The pipeline is
**highly sensitive to hyperparameters** — loss weights, learning rate, training
window, and data features all interact non-trivially. Results will vary across
configurations and market regimes. Reproducing or improving them requires
systematic experimentation, which the codebase is designed to support.

This is research, not a production-ready system.

## Results

### Experiment: `itransformer_hybrid`

**Configuration summary:**
- Backbone: iTransformer (d_model=32, n_layers=4) — 52K parameters
- Features: ohlcv + rolling_vol (6 channels), 30-min bars
- Training data: Jan 2024 → Mar 2025 (15 months, 910 non-overlapping samples)
- Loss: Hybrid (Sharpe + drawdown + flat_target + bias)
- Training: 30 epochs, lr=1e-3, mirror_augmentation=True

**Why small model, short window, and non-overlapping samples:**
910 samples is intentionally small. With `stride=horizon_len=24` (non-overlapping
episodes), each training sample covers a distinct 12-hour market window, preventing
the model from memorising sequential price paths. A 52K-parameter model on 910
samples is deliberately capacity-constrained to resist microstructure noise.

The 15-month training window (Jan 2024 – Mar 2025) keeps the training regime
temporally close to the evaluation periods, reducing distribution shift. Extending
to earlier data is straightforward via `SplitConfig.train_start` and is the
recommended first ablation step.

### Training dynamics

| Epoch | Val Sharpe | Val Return | Flat% | Turnover/bar |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | −6.49 | −14.1% | 1.6% | 0.0335 |
| 10 | −0.72 | −1.1% | 56.8% | 0.0002 |
| 20 | +1.21 | +5.2% | 15.4% | 0.0101 |
| 30 | **+1.25** | +5.8% | 13.2% | 0.0135 |

Best checkpoint saved at epoch 30 — val Sharpe still improving at run end,
indicating the model had not yet converged.

### Walk-forward evaluation

All evaluation uses the continuous walk-forward protocol — identical to
live execution mechanics. No look-ahead, no episode resets.

**Test — July–September 2025 (3 months, out-of-sample)**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Sharpe (ann.) | **+1.735** |
| Sortino (ann.) | **+2.173** |
| Calmar | 1.346 |
| Total return | +8.22% |
| Max drawdown | 6.10% |
| Commission paid | 2.50% |
| Rebalances | 79 |
| Long / Short / Flat | 66.9% / 17.3% / 15.8% |

**Backtest — October–December 2025 (final hold-out, never touched during training)**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Sharpe (ann.) | **+1.152** |
| Sortino (ann.) | **+1.250** |
| Calmar | 0.874 |
| Total return | +6.91% |
| Max drawdown | 7.91% |
| Commission paid | 2.60% |
| Rebalances | 76 |
| Long / Short / Flat | 53.3% / 20.9% / 25.8% |

### Key observations

**Positive Sharpe on both held-out periods.** Test (+1.73) and backtest (+1.15)
are both positive — this is the primary result. A single positive out-of-sample
period can be coincidence; consistency across two non-overlapping quarters
is a stronger signal.

**Asymmetric learning from symmetric data.** The model was trained exclusively
on Jan 2024 – Mar 2025 data — a predominantly bullish period for BTC.
With `mirror_augmentation=True`, the training loop augments 50% of batches by
inverting price returns, forcing the model to learn symmetric long/short behaviour.
The result: 17–21% short exposure in evaluation, despite the long-biased training
regime. Without augmentation, all previous experiments produced `short_fraction=0`.

**Direction accuracy near 50%.** Long correct: 50.1–51.2%, short correct: 48.8–52.6%.
The model's edge does not come from directional prediction accuracy but from
**asymmetric sizing** — `correct_avg_ret` (+0.065%) systematically exceeds
`incorrect_avg_ret` (−0.061%) in magnitude. The gate mechanism selectively
suppresses low-confidence trades, improving the signal-to-noise ratio of
executed positions.

**Gate activation remains low.** Mean gate ≈ 0.12–0.13. The model spends the
majority of its time at partial exposure rather than full commitment. This is
consistent with a conservative risk posture driven by `lambda_bias` and
`flat_target` regularisation.

---

## Limitations

**Single asset.** The pipeline trains one model per instrument.
Multi-asset portfolio construction requires architectural extension.

**Flat commission model.** Costs are `commission_rate + slippage_rate` applied
uniformly. For positions large enough to move price, enable `market_impact_eta`
in `SimulatorConfig` (quadratic Almgren-Chriss term).

**Research framework.** There is no live execution layer. Connecting to a broker
API requires additional engineering outside the scope of this project.

---

## Roadmap

The following directions are planned for future development, roughly in order
of research priority:

**Multi-asset portfolio extension.**
The current architecture optimises a single instrument. Extending to a portfolio
requires a cross-asset attention layer and a portfolio-level Sharpe objective
that accounts for correlation between positions. The differentiable simulator
generalises naturally: `gross_t = Σ weights_{i,t-1} × ret_{i,t}`.

**Richer loss functions.**
The hybrid loss is still a first approximation. Planned extensions include
Calmar-based objectives, conditional drawdown penalties, and regime-aware
loss weighting that adjusts λ values based on detected volatility regime.

**Additional backbones.**
The LSTM encoder is implemented but not yet benchmarked against iTransformer
under identical conditions. Planned ablations include PatchTST, Mamba, and
linear attention variants.

**Online data pipeline.**
A scheduled data collection layer (Binance WebSocket → local store → feature
pipeline → model inference) to support paper trading and live monitoring.

**Execution and risk layer.**
A broker-facing execution module with position sizing, stop-loss enforcement,
and exchange connectivity. This is the final step before any live deployment
and is outside the current research scope.
